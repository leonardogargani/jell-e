# Jell-E

![jell-e](img/logo.png)

Jell-E is a robot built for the Robotics & Design course at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2021/2022.




The general theme of this year's edition is "Wearable Robot".

In particular, the goal is to make a robot able to engage interactions with third people, performing actions based on the behavior of both the wearer and other people.

To better know the Jell-E, take a look at:
- the [presentation slides](docs/presentation_slides.pdf)
- the [complete report](docs/complete_report.pdf)
- the [user manual](docs/user_manual.pdf)
- the [maintenance manual](docs/maintenance_manual.pdf)


## Repository structure

The repository is divided into the following directories:
- [esp32/](esp32/), containing the Arduino code that runs on the ESP32;
- [models/](models/), containing all the models (OpenSCAD and SolidWorks) for the parts of the robot;
- [schematic/](schematic/), containing the schematic of the circuit with all the sensors and actuators;
- [stl/](stl/), containing the STL files to print all the parts;
- [docs/](docs/), containing the user manual, the maintenance manual, some presentation slides, and the complete report.
